# **Machine Learning - Homework**

## **Summary**

#### The Machine Learning homework comprised of two jupyter notebooks.  The data used was comprised loans and to use the data to conduct a risk analysis using different models.

 
#### The first notebook focused on sampling.  An analysis was conducted using different models including simple regression, oversampling, SMOTE oversampling, undersampling and combination sampling.


#### After review it appeared that the SMOTE and undersampling models yielded the best and most accurate results.  It yielded higher precision and recall results.


#### The second notebook focused on ensemble learning.  We focused on using the Balanced Random Forest Classifier and Easy Ensemble Classifier models.

#### Results concluded that the Easy Ensemble Classifier model provided the best results with highest accuracy.  Using the importance function, we were able to assess the most important fields.  We were also able to assess via the Easy Ensemble Classifier model that it had the best precision and recall values.
